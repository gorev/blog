# Quiche

One of my all-time favorites – perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It’s a bit of work, but so worth it.

## Components

Quiche might seem like rocket science, but it’s actually quite simple and comes down to three main parts: the crust, the fillings, and the egg mixture.

Once you have the crust ready, just add your fillings and pour in the egg mixture. That’s pretty much it.

## Inspiration

I took inspiration from two Japanese Youtubers (I know, lol), and used their recipes as a base. I then tweaked them to my liking.

I highly recommend watching the videos below — they’ll walk you through most of the techniques.

## Ingredients

Since I’m based in Berlin, I found most of the ingredients at REWE supermarket. I’ll link to the specific products I used so you can pick up the same ones or use them as a guide.

### Crust (classic)

| Ingredient                  | Quantity |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| All-purpose flour           | 260 g    |
| Butter                      | 120 g    |

| Salt                        | To taste |

### Crust (gluten-free)

The gluten-free crust isn’t quite as good as the classic one and tends to crack when rolled out. Still worth it if you’re eating gluten-free.

### Egg Mixture

When deciding how much salt to add, think about how much you’d use to season a six egg omelette.

## Instructions

### Making and blind baking the crust

1. Grate the butter and mix it with the flour.
2. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt.
3. Add the eggs to the flour mixture and knead until a dough forms.
4. Shape the dough into a thick, round disc, wrap it in plastic, and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.
5. Grease your baking dish with butter or olive oil to prevent sticking.
6. Roll out the dough, place it in the baking dish, and prick it with a fork to allow air to escape.
7. Cover the dough with aluminum foil and add pie weights—ceramic baking beads, dry beans, or rice.
8. Pre-bake the crust at 180°C for 20 minutes.
