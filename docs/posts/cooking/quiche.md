# Quiche

One of my all-time favorites – perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It’s a bit of work, but so worth it.

## Components

Quiche might seem like rocket science, but it’s actually quite simple and comes down to three main parts: the crust, the fillings, and the egg mixture.

Once you have the crust ready, just add your fillings and pour in the egg mixture. That’s pretty much it.

## Inspiration

I took inspiration from two Japanese Youtubers (I know, lol), and used their recipes as a base. I then tweaked them to my liking.

I highly recommend watching the videos below — they’ll walk you through most of the techniques.

## Ingredients

Since I’m based in Berlin, I found most of the ingredients at REWE supermarket. I’ll link to the specific products I used so you can pick up the same ones or use them as a guide.
